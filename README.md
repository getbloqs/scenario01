# Scenario 01: Smart contract for a sports bet

## Prerequisits

 - truffle v3.4.7+
 - testrpc v4.0.1+

[truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) and [testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) are written as javascript/node programs and can be easily installed via `npm`.

## Testing

Tests for the smart contracts are included and can be run with truffle. Therefore a running instance of testrpc is required. This can be done by running `npm run testrpc`. Either run this in the background with `&` or open another terminal and trigger `npm test` to run the tests.
