# Scenario 01: Smart contract for a sports bet

## Testing

Tests for the smart contracts are included and can be run with truffle. Therefore a running instance of testrpc is required. This can be done by running `testrpc`. Either run this in the background with `&` or open another terminal and trigger `truffle test` to run the tests. All steps are combined for bash environments by running `npm test`.

 - `npm i`
 - `npm test`
